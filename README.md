# 🧠 Neural Network vs CNN on Fashion MNIST

This project compares a fully connected Neural Network (NN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the Fashion MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## 📌 Key Features

- Implementation of both NN and CNN using PyTorch
- Visual training history (accuracy and loss)
- Displays 5 sample test predictions with actual vs predicted labels
- Final test accuracy comparison between models
- Clean and reproducible notebook

## 📊 Final Accuracy

| Model | Test Accuracy |
|-------|---------------|
| NN    | 87.21%        |
| CNN   | 91.72%        |

✅ CNN outperformed NN by 4.52%%
